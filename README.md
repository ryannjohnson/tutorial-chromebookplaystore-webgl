## Compile

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run server
```

You can then navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:8080/> or whatever addresses your terminal displays.

### Development

The `package.json` file contains some scripts for watching changes to files. To automatically compile changes to the Javascript files, open up a new terminal and run:

```bash
$ npm run watch-js
```
